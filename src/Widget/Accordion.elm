{-| Functions which indicate how to display your `entry` type as an
accordion section.

`viewHeader` and `viewPanel` will be called with each `entry` to render
the title and body of a particular accordion section, respectively.
These functions will be passed a single `entry` and should render it
appropriately. In the simplest case, just use `Html.text` to render text only,
but you might also want to render (for example) an icon in the header or
structured paragraphs in the body.

`setExpanded` will be called to translate header clicks into `Message` values, so you can
update your model as appropriate. It receives a `Bool` indicating whether
the given `entry` is to become expanded, followed by the `entry` itself.

`getExpanded` will be called with an `entry` to determine whether it ought
to be displayed in expanded form.

{-| Render an Accordion view.

An accordion is rendered as a list of sections, each with a header and body, and each
with a notion of whether it is expanded or collapsed. When the user clicks
a given header, the accordion sends a `Message` requesting that the section
in question swap its expandedness/collapsedness.

Provide a list of `entry` values, and an `Accordion` record that indicates
how we can display an `entry` as an accordion section.
